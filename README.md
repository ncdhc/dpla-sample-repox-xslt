DPLA Sample REPOX XSLT
======================

This repository contains sample XSLT documents in support of aggregating multiple institutions'
OAI-PMH feeds using REPOX (http://repox.ist.utl.pt/) feed aggregation software for harvest by
the Digital Public Library of America (DPLA). 

Included at this time are oai_dc to MODS transformations; oai_dc is the most commonly provided
and supported metadata format, to be transformed to a specific MODS profile developed by the NCDHC
with support of the DPLA. A crosswalk between oai_dc and MODS can be found on the 'MODS' tab of 
DPLA's working document, "DPLA Partners Crosswalk":
(https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/ccc?key=0ApDps8nOS9g5dHp5ZE10YS10amljdXRVS3dqYXRvTXc#gid=1).

A description of the architecture of these files and how to incorporate them into REPOX can be 
found here: http://www.dlib.org/dlib/july14/gregory/07gregory.html
